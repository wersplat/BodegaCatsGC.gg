    <h1>About Bodega Cats GC</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><span class="emoji">üèôÔ∏è</span>2021 ‚Äì Born in the Bodega</h2>
      <p>Bodega Cats GC was founded in late 2021 with a simple vision: build something real for the NBA‚ÄØ2K scene‚Äîrooted in culture, competitive excellence, and community. Inspired by the bodega cats of New York, the name symbolized grit, hustle, and street-smart survival‚Äîtraits that mirror the Pro-Am grind.</p>
      <p>At first, Bodega Cats GC was just a team. A handful of high-IQ players, a Twitter account with jokes and game links, and a logo that looked like it meant business. But even then, the identity was distinct‚Äîno gimmicks, no forced clout chasing‚Äîjust gameplay and personality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><span class="emoji">üß¢</span>2022‚Äì2023 ‚Äì From Team to Brand</h2>
      <p>Over the next two years, Bodega Cats evolved from a single roster into a multi-team brand. They fielded squads in leagues like WR, MPBA, TPL, and UPA, regularly making deep playoff runs and gaining a rep for discipline and high IQ basketball.</p>
      <p>They also started sponsoring and supporting other 2K teams, providing structure, branding, and visibility. The name began to mean more than just gameplay‚Äîit meant trust, identity, and consistency in a chaotic scene.</p>
      <p>Bodega Cats focused on elevating the culture, not chasing clout. Their approach was player-first, community-minded, and always competitive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><span class="emoji">üéÆ</span>2K24 ‚Äì Building Infrastructure Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>In 2K24, Bodega Cats GC began stepping into a new role‚Äînot just competing, but actively shaping the competitive landscape. Behind the scenes, they started contributing to how leagues and tournaments were run:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Offering input on league formats and rulesets</li>
        <li>Assisting with bracket design and registration workflows</li>
        <li>Supporting other orgs and creators with branding and visual content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While still competing in top leagues, Bodega‚Äôs influence expanded into league operations, creative direction, and structural leadership. Quietly but deliberately, they became a group players trusted and organizers leaned on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2><span class="emoji">üì¢</span>2K25 ‚Äì From Players to Promoters</h2>
      <p>2K25 marked the year Bodega Cats GC fully transitioned from elite competitors to respected organizers and creative producers in the Pro-Am ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Their long-running league series, <strong>Road to $25K</strong>, officially evolved into what became the <strong>UPA Summer Championships</strong>‚Äîa high-profile tournament originally planned as a LAN but ultimately executed as a virtual championship.</p>
      <p>Bodega had spent multiple seasons laying the groundwork:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A structured promotion/relegation system</li>
        <li>Performance-based qualification</li>
        <li>Transparent rankings across multiple divisions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That ecosystem funneled into a unified postseason vision‚Äîa culmination meant to reward the best teams across all levels. When the planned LAN event was cancelled, Bodega didn‚Äôt let the momentum die. Instead, they pivoted and scaled the competition online, helping UPA execute one of the most organized virtual championships in the scene.</p>
      <p>By the end of 2K25, Bodega Cats GC had proven they could build leagues, adapt under pressure, and elevate online play to LAN-caliber prestige. They weren‚Äôt just competing in the new era of 2K‚Äîthey were helping define it.</p>
