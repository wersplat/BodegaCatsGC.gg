  <h1>Christian “Cager”</h1>
  <h2>Founder & Creative Director<br>Bodega Cats GC</h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>Christian — better known in the esports world as “Cager” — is the founder and creative engine behind Bodega Cats GC, one of the most respected independent organizations in the NBA 2K Pro-Am community. A native New Yorker with a background in both competitive sports and digital strategy, Christian launched Bodega Cats in 2021 with a clear mission: build something real in the Pro-Am ecosystem — something rooted in culture, structure, and purpose.</p>

  <p>The name Bodega Cats GC is more than branding. Inspired by the iconic cats that roam New York City’s corner stores, it reflects a survival mindset, street-smart awareness, and quiet confidence — the very traits Christian saw missing in much of the 2K scene. From day one, he built the organization with those values at its core.</p>

  <h2>Player-First, Community-Minded</h2>

  <p>At the heart of Christian’s leadership is a deep respect for players and the community that surrounds them. While many teams focus on clout and quick wins, Christian prioritized long-term growth, personal development, and ecosystem health.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>For Players:</strong> Christian ensures every team under the Bodega banner is structured, scouted, and supported. From scheduling and scrims to social media presence and branding, players get what they need to compete at the highest level — not just in-game, but as part of their broader career journey. He’s helped rookies become leaders, connected unknown talent to the spotlight, and backed veteran players with tools to stay relevant in a fast-changing landscape.</li>
    <li><strong>For the Community:</strong> Christian believes competitive 2K thrives when everyone — not just the top 1% — has a path to grow. Through the Road to $25K series, grassroots support of smaller teams, and creative partnerships with organizers, he’s expanded access and visibility across the scene. He’s also worked behind the scenes helping leagues tighten rulesets, polish broadcasts, and create systems that feel professional — because he knows structure is what makes the difference between a moment and a movement.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This ethos shows in everything Bodega does: respectful competition, premium visuals, consistent engagement, and a willingness to support rivals if it means elevating the whole space. Christian’s belief is simple — if you make the environment better, everyone plays better.</p>

  <h2>Beyond the Court</h2>

  <p>Under Christian's leadership, Bodega Cats GC evolved from a single squad into a full-fledged brand. They've competed in elite leagues like WR, MPBA, TPL, and UPA; fielded multiple rosters; and provided visual, operational, and promotional support to teams across the country. Christian is currently leading the proamrank.gg project, organizing the UPA World Championships (July 24-26, 2026 at Hyper X Arena in Las Vegas), and launching the Legends Basketball Association (lba.gg) — all created to give players a true roadmap to success.</p>

  <p>Whether he’s coordinating live drafts, breaking down stats, mentoring team captains, or building out tournament infrastructure, Christian is hands-on, strategic, and relentlessly community-focused. He wears every hat — coach, designer, GM, and storyteller — and ensures that every project stays true to the culture that built it.</p>

  <hr />

  <em>“The bodega’s open” isn’t just a tagline — it’s Christian’s way of saying that everyone is welcome to compete, create, and build together. As long as you’re about the work, there’s a home here.</em>
